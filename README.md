# Number-guessing-game-by-computer

#This Python code implements a number guessing game where the computer attempts to guess a number selected by the user. The user provides feedback—'bigger', 'smaller', or 'correct'—after each guess. Based on this feedback, the computer adjusts its subsequent guesses within #the updated range. The game continues until the computer correctly identifies the user's number.

Purpose of the Code:

This code serves as an interactive game where the computer tries to guess a number chosen by the user. It demonstrates the use of control structures, user input handling, and random number generation in Python. The game provides a practical example of implementing a simple algorithm that adjusts its behavior based on user feedback
